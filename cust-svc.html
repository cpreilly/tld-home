<p>At Troy Lee Designs we take great pride in the quality and fit of each of our products. We will stand behind them 100%. If for any reason, you have not been completely satisfied, TLD will provide the following warranty policy.</p>
<p>We offer warranty inspection on all our products. The warranty policy covers the product only in the case of manufacture defect. It does not cover products damaged due to normal wear and tear, negligence, improper care, natural breaking or fading of colors and materials over time and/or exposure.</p>
<p>If the product is defective you can send it in to TLD for a warranty inspection. All warranty inspection will require a warranty authorization number (WA) in order to be inspected. If the product was purchased from a dealer, the dealer must contact TLD directly in order to receive a WA number. If the product was purchased directly from us, you will need to call TLD to receive a WA number. TLD requires all items sent in for repair must be clean. All products sent to us for warranty inspection should be sent prepaid freight and insured. Troy Lee Designs will not be held responsible for lost packages.</p>
<p>You will be contacted once the inspection is completed and informed on what action will be taken.</p>

                    <h4>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability </h4>
                    <p>By using the TLD website, you expressly agree that use of the TLD website is at your sole risk. The TLD website is provided on an "AS IS" and "as available" basis.

Troy Lee Designs and its Associates specifically disclaim all warranties, whether expressed or implied, including but not limited to warranties of title, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. No oral advice or written information given by Troy Lee Designs or its Associates shall create a warranty.

                    <p>Under no circumstances shall Troy Lee Designs or its Associates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from your use of or inability to use the TLD website, including but not limited to reliance by you on any information obtained from the TLD website that results in mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion or corruption of files, viruses, delays in operation or transmission, or any failure of performance. The foregoing Limitation of Liability shall apply in any action, whether in contract, tort or any other claim, even if an authorized representative of Troy Lee Designs has been advised of or should have knowledge of the possibility of such damages. User hereby acknowledges that this paragraph shall apply to all content, merchandise and services available through the TLD website. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. </p>
                    <h4>Product Display/Colors </h4>
                    <p>The TLD website attempts to display product images shown on the site as accurately as possible. However, we cannot guarantee that the color you see matches the product color, as the display of the color depends, in part, upon the monitor you are using. </p>
                    <h4>Errors on Our Site </h4>
                    <p>Prices and availability of products and services are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected where discovered, and Troy Lee Designs reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions including after an order has been submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, Troy Lee Designs will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Individual bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your account. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you may return it in accordance with Troy Lee Designs' Shipping &amp; Returns Policy. </p>
                    <h4>Pricing Policy </h4>
                    <p>Online prices and selection generally match those in stores, but may vary. Prices and offers are subject to change. </p>
                    <h4>Sales Tax Policy </h4>
                    <p>Troy Lee Designs collects and remits sales tax as required by U.S. law, for transactions in our stores and on troyleedesigns.com.

                    <h4>Paying for Your Order </h4>
                    <p>You may pay for your orders with major credit cards issued in the United States of America. Currently, we accept Visa&reg;, MasterCard&reg;, American Express&reg; and Discover&reg; Card. </p>
                    <p>Generally, credit and debit card are not charged until we either ship the item(s) to you or confirm their availability (at which time you will be charged only for the goods we have actually shipped along with any appropriate taxes or shipping charges). However, we may pre-authorize your order amount with your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When paying for a preorder with a debit card you will be charged at the time you place your preorder. Please contact your credit card issuer for more information. </p>
                    <p>If you ordered a special delivery item, you will be charged once a delivery time is confirmed. </p>
                    <h4>Using Promotional Codes </h4>
                    <p>Unlike credit or debit cards, Promotional Codes used on Digital Coupons are debited at the time an order is placed. Digital Coupons will automatically be redeemed to purchase totals, up to the total purchase amount. Digital Coupons must be used prior to their noted expiration date and within a single transaction. A coupon cannot be replaced if it is lost, stolen, deleted, or if you cancel or return your purchase. In the event of a reduction in price below the coupon value, the excess value of the coupon will not be refunded. </p>
                    <h4>Validating Your Order </h4>
                    <p>After you place an order using our shopping cart, we will check the information you give us for validity, by verifying your method of payment or shipping address. We reserve the right to reject any order you place with us, and/or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any reason. If we reject your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address and/or telephone number you have given us with the order. Your credit or debit card will normally not be charged if we reject an order, but we will process a refund if the charge has been made against your card. </p>
                    <h4>Order Limitations/Limited Quantities </h4>
                    <p>Troy Lee Designs may, at its own discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. Troy Lee Designs also reserves the right to reject any order you place with us. These restrictions may include orders placed by the same TLD website account, the same credit card, and orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event we make a change to an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address provided at the time the order was made. Troy Lee Designs reserves the right to limit or prohibit sales to dealers. </p>
                    <h4>Termination of Use</h4>
                    <p>Troy Lee Designs may, in its sole discretion, terminate your account or your use of the TLD website at anytime. You are personally liable for any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination.
